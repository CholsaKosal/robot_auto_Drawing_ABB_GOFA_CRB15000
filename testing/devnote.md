There is a **major potential advantage** to removing the "Done" (`D`) acknowledgement, but it comes with a significant trade-off in robustness.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown:

### The Advantage: Speed and Fluid Motion (Streaming)

By removing the `SocketSend` for "D" and the corresponding `receive` call in Python, you change the protocol from a **synchronous "lock-step" system** to an **asynchronous "streaming" system**.

* **Current "Lock-Step" Method:** The Python script sends a command and then waits until the robot has physically **finished** the movement before it sends the next command. This is very safe but can result in choppy or slow movements, as the robot comes to a brief stop after every single `MoveL` command to wait for the next instruction.

* **Proposed "Streaming" Method:** If you remove the "D" acknowledgement, the Python script only waits for the "Ready" (`R`) confirmation. This confirmation simply means "I have received and understood the command." The Python script can then immediately send the *next* command while the robot is still busy executing the *previous* one.

The robot controller has an internal buffer and can queue up these incoming movement commands. This allows the controller to blend the movements together, resulting in a much faster, smoother, and more continuous drawing path. This is the single biggest advantage.

### The Disadvantage: Risk and Loss of Synchronization

The "Done" (`D`) acknowledgement provides a crucial piece of information: **positive confirmation that the requested task was completed successfully.** Removing it introduces risks:

* **Buffer Overflow:** The Python script could potentially send commands much faster than the robot can execute them. This could overwhelm the robot controller's movement buffer, leading to errors or unpredictable behavior. The "Done" acknowledgement acts as a natural rate limiter, preventing this from ever happening.

* **Loss of State Tracking:** You no longer know for certain that a move has been completed. If the robot encounters a physical obstruction or an error during a move, the Python script will be "flying blind," unaware of the problem, and will continue sending more commands. This makes error recovery and features like "reconnect and resume" much more difficult to implement reliably.

### Conclusion: Is it worth it?

It's a classic trade-off between **speed and safety**.

* For applications where **absolute certainty and simple error recovery** are paramount, the current lock-step protocol with both "Ready" and "Done" acknowledgements is superior.
* For an application like **drawing**, where speed and smooth, continuous motion are highly desirable, moving to a streaming protocol by removing the "Done" acknowledgement is often the right choice.

To do it safely, you would typically implement a more advanced flow control mechanism. For example, instead of sending one command at a time, you could send a small batch (e.g., 10 commands), wait for all 10 "Ready" acknowledgements, and then send the next batch. This keeps the robot's buffer full enough for smooth motion but prevents it from overflowing.
